## Curio's Workshop
Somewhere in the city of Streets of Rogue lived an inventor-collector by the name Curio. And he had a warehouse stuffed with many antique oddities, his own contraptions, and rare objects. One day, one of the many Mayors the city had decided to nationalize the warehouse, to use its contents for their own goals. Mayor's henchmen knew nothing about the oddities contained in the warehouse, and things quickly went awry. Slum dwellers, gangsters and thieves that were nearby looted everything from the warehouse, and eventually these items started circulating around the entire city. Shortly after this, Curio joined the Resistance, set up a workshop, and began constructing some mysterious machine...

## "Photography update"

**🔷 Item "Photo Camera"**  
A reusable camera. Takes a screenshot of a small area of the screen, and gives you a unique Photo item (non-stackable). When you take a photo, all nearby Cops get angry (referencing the cut 7th Law of the Land). The film can be refilled at any Loadout-O-Matic.

**🔷 Item "Disposable Camera"**  
Works the same way as a Photo Camera, but disappears on use.

**🔷 Item "Photo"**  
A photo taken with a Photo Camera or a Disposable Camera. Can be used to open a window showing the taken screenshot. Can be sold for some money - the amount depends on objects and events depicted in the photo. If an NPC in the photo is doing something illegal/suspicious/bad, the player can use it to blackmail them, or report them to the Cops.

**🔷 Character "Photographer"**  
A character class, centered around taking pictures of stuff and making use of them.  
Endurance 2/4, Speed 3/4, Melee 1/4, Firearms 2/4.  
Starts with a Photo Camera. (traits?)

**🔷 Super Special Trait "Weighted Shoes"**  
You can take wider shots (+25% to both width and height).

**🔷 Super Special Trait "Steady Hand"**  
Photos never turn out blurry.

**🔷 Super Special Trait "X-Ray Lens"**  
You can take shots through walls.

**🔷 Trait "Person(al) Radar"**  
NPCs that you have taken a picture of will be tracked on the map.

**🔷 Trait "Person(al) Radar+"**  
You can teleport to NPCs you take pictures of.

**🔷 Trait "Spirit Photography"**  
Sometimes you will catch ghostlike apparitions on photos! Apparitions increase the photo's value. You can also show them to people to scare them away from the place where the picture was taken.

**🔷 Item "Streamcorder"**  
Works similar to a Disposable Camera, except that it creates Live Photos instead of regular ones (inspired by SCP-105-B).

**🔷 Item "Live Photo"**  
A photo (video?) taken with a Streamcorder. Can be used to open a window depicting the captured location in real time.

**🔷 Item "Soul Stealer"**  
A camera that steals souls! All NPCs with souls in the photographed area will turn into mindless angry walking corpses.

## "Lighting update"

**🔷 Item "Flashlight"**  
Does exactly what you would expect it to do. 100% charge = 5 minutes. It's a passive item that you can turn on and off.

**🔷 Item "UV Flashlight"**  
Works like a Flashlight, but also reveals footprints and traps. Burns Vampires. Can also be used to open Safes through a mini-game (there will be a 9-key keypad with fingerprints). 100% charge = 2 minutes.

**🔷 Item "Shadowlight"**  
Works like a Flashlight, except it emits darkness instead of light.

**🔷 Item "Disco Grenade"**  
When thrown, spawns a disco ball and a projector. The disco ball floats up into the sky, and the projector stays on the ground, illuminating the disco ball and everything around in all the colors. Emits music as well, so the NPCs in a certain range gather around and start dancing.

## Miscellaneous

**🔷 Item "Superhot Watch"**  
A pocket watch capable of stopping time when you're not moving (yep, it's a reference to Superhot). This effect only lasts for 10 seconds after using the item. After a random amount of uses (between 2 and 6), breaks and becomes unusable. A broken watch can be repaired by a Watchmaker NPC.

**🔷 Character "Watchmaker"**  
An exclusively non-playable character. (spawns where?)



**🔷 Object "Ghostmogrifier"**  
A mysterious machine that Curio's been working on at the Home Base. Upon collecting the necessary rare components from around the city, Curio reveals it to be a Ghostmogrifier - a machine that turns you into a Ghost. This machine appears only at the Home Base and can be used to select and play as Ghost versions of normal characters.
